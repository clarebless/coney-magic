           <h2>Submarine in Coney Island Creek!</h2>
            <p>For as long as anyone can remember, the weathered hull of a partly submerged yellow submarine has protruded from the water of the creek. The Yellow Submarine built Jerry Biano. Biano’s goal was to use the ship to salvage the lost treasures of the sunken Andrea Doria. Launched in Coney Island Creek in 1970, the submarine never sailed.  When lowered into the water the sub listed severely to one side and could never be launched.

         <h2>Coney Island is no longer an island!</h2>
          <p>Through the turn of the 20th century Coney Island was still an island, being separated from the main part of Brooklyn by the 3 mile long Coney Island Creek.  By 1924 local land owners had filled a portion of the creek and a major section of the creek was further filled in to allow construction of the Belt Parkway in the 1930s. More fill was added in 1962 with the construction of the Verrazano–Narrows Bridge. The western and eastern ends of the island became a peninsulas.

        <h1>Coney Island's History</h1>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          
          <p>At the time of European settlement the land that makes up the present day Coney Island was divided across several separate islands that, over the years, were changing shape because of the constant redeposit of sand due to tidal and storm forces, as well as the reshaping of the island by local residents.</p>
          <br>
          
          <p>The western most island was Coney Island, a 1.25 mile shifting sandspit with a detached island at its western end extending into Lower New York Bay.</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <p>East of Coney was originally a peninsula called Coney Hook but in 1750 a canal (called the "Jamaica Ditch") was dug through the Coney Hook salt-marsh from Brown’s creek east to Hubbard’s creek. This connection to the waterways behind the islands allowed shipping traffic to travel from Jamaica Bay to New York Harbor without having to venture out into the ocean. The canal turned Coney Hook into a detached half mile long island called Pine Island, due to the woods on it.</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <p>Each island was separated by an inlet that could only be crossed at low tide. By the end of the 1700s the ongoing shifting of sand along the barrier islands had closed up the inlets to the point that residents began filling them in, eventually joining all the islands into the single present day Coney Island.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coney_Island" target="_blank"> Read More</a> </p>
          
          <p>Between about 1880 and World War II, Coney Island was the largest amusement area in the United States. At its height, it contained three competing major amusement parks, Luna Park, Dreamland, and Steeplechase Park, as well as many independent amusements. The area was also the center of new technological events, with electric lights, roller coasters, and baby incubators among the innovations at Coney Island in the 1900s. This continued through the end of World War II, with world's fair-style structures such as the Parachute Jump and Wonder Wheel.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coney_Island" target="_blank"> Read More</a></p>

        <h2>Coney Island Today</h2>
          <br>
          <br>
          
          <p>Currently, Coney Island has two amusement parks — Luna Park and Deno's Wonder Wheel Amusement Park — as well as several rides that are not incorporated into either theme park. Coney Island also has several other visitor attractions and hosts renowned events as well. Coney Island's amusement area is one of a few in the United States that is not mostly owned by any one entity. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coney_Island" target="_blank"> Read More</a></p>
          
          <br>
          
          <p>Three rides at Coney Island are protected as designated New York City landmarks and are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. These three rides are:</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <p> Wonder Wheel – built in 1918 and opened in 1920, this steel Ferris wheel has both stationary cars and rocking cars that slide along a track. It holds 144 riders, stands 150 ft (46 m) tall, and weighs over 200 tons. At night, the Wonder Wheel's steel frame is outlined and illuminated by neon tubes.[55] It is located at Deno's Wonder Wheel Amusement Park.</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <p>The Cyclone roller coaster – built in 1927, it is one of the United States's oldest wooden coasters still in operation. Popular with roller coaster aficionados, the Cyclone includes an 85 ft (26 m), 60-degree drop. It is owned by the City of New York, and was operated by Astroland, under a franchise agreement. It is now located in and operated by Luna Park.</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <p>Parachute Jump – originally built as the Life Savers Parachute Jump at the 1939 New York World's Fair, this was the first ride of its kind. Patrons were hoisted 190 ft (58 m) in the air before being allowed to drop using guy-wired parachutes. Although the ride has been closed since 1968, it remains a Coney Island landmark and is sometimes referred to as Brooklyn's Eiffel Tower. Between 2002 and 2004, it was completely dismantled, cleaned, painted, and restored, but remains inactive. After an official lighting ceremony in July 2006, the Parachute Jump was slated to be lit year-round using different color motifs to represent the seasons. However, this idea was scrapped when New York City started conserving electricity in the summer months, and it has not been lit regularly since.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coney_Island" target="_blank"> Read More</a></p>
