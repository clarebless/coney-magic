        <h2>Coney Island Circus Sideshow</h2>
        <br>
       
        <p>The last traditional 10-in 1 continuous sideshow performing in a circus or amusement context includes a cast of live professional performers, many at the top of their field. Located in the home of sideshow culture, in an official New York City Landmark with its own sideshow pedigree, and offering traditional shows and Sideshow School, our facility is to sideshow culture what the Actor’s Studio is to American acting: we are the International Center of Sideshow Arts.</p>
        
        <br>
       
        <p>The 2017 sideshow will remain at an affordable price, in keeping with our mission, although, because of the extraordinary costs of rebuilding after Sandy, we are hoping to find alternative ways of subsidizing this ticket price – through additional memberships, a donation drive at the ticket box, and new ways of communicating who we are to visitors who think we’re just “a part of the amusement park”.<a href="http://www.coneyisland.com/programs/coney-island-circus-sideshow">For more information click here!</a><a href="http://www.coneyisland.com/programs/congress-curious-peoples">And click here!</a> </p>

        <h2>The 35th Annual Mermaid Parade is Saturday, June 17, 2017, 1pm!</h2>
        
        <br>
        
        
        <p>The MERMAID PARADE specifically was founded in 1983 with 3 goals: it brings mythology to life for local residents who live on streets named Mermaid and Neptune ; it creates self-esteem in a district that is often disregarded as “entertainment”; and it lets artistic New Yorkers find self-expression in public.</p>
        
        <p>A celebration of ancient mythology and honky-tonk rituals of the seaside, it showcases over 3,000 creative individuals from all over the five boroughs and beyond, opening the summer with incredible art, entrepreneurial spirit and community pride. The parade highlights Coney Island Pageantry based on a century of many Coney parades, celebrates the artistic vision of the masses, and ensures that the summer season is a success by bringing hundreds of thousands of people to the amusement area in a single day, June 17, 2017.<a href="http://www.coneyisland.com/programs/mermaid-parade">For more information click here!</a></p>

           <h2>The birthplace of the frozen custard</h2>

           <p>In 1919, Archie C. Kohr sought a solution to a problem that vexed ice cream sellers at Coney Island: How to keep the frozen dessert from melting too quickly in the summer heat. His solution was to add egg yolks to the usual mixture of cream and sugar of ice cream, creating the world’s first frozen custard. This new frozen dessert melted more slowly, and had the silky texture of soft serve ice cream. Legend has it that he and his brother sold over 18,000 cones the first weekend it went on sale.</p><a href="www.amny.com/secrets-of-new-york/secrets-of-coney-island-1.10182810">For more infomation click here.</a>

           <p>Spook-A-Rama is the last "dark ride" at Coney Island. Extensively refurbished after Superstorm Sandy's surge tide flooded it, the ride continues to spook with its ghoulish props.</p><a href="www.amny.com/secrets-of-new-york/secrets-of-coney-island-1.10182810">For more infomation click here.</a>

           <p>Gray-haired and with a kind smile, Grandma at Deno's Wonder Wheel Amusement Park sits in a wood booth purveying predictions to the delight of Coney Island visitors for decades. In fact, it's the oldest and most rare arcade machine on the island.</p>> <a href="www.amny.com/secrets-of-new-york/secrets-of-coney-island-1.10182810">For more infomation click here.</a>

          <h2>The Parachute Jump attracted crowds with ‘screamers’</h2>

          <p>The 250-foot Parachute Jump had all the characteristics of a terrifying amusement ride when it opened at Steeplechase Park in the 1940s. Designed to train paratroops and put into entertainment service at Coney Island, it simulated the experience of falling to earth in a parachute.</p> 
           
          <p>But it struggled to be a viable business. So the operators of the ride came up with a novel idea, Denson told amNewYork. The operators would entice young women who looked like "screamers" to jump on. But they would keep the ladies hanging suspended in the air, so that the women, as expected, would scream in terror.</p>

          <p>That brought out crowds, but even these guerrilla marketing tactics weren't enough to keep it from closing down with the park in 1964.</p>

          <p>And in spite of rumors, no one was ever killed on the ride, which is now a landmark, according to the Coney Island History Project.</p> <a href="www.amny.com/secrets-of-new-york/secrets-of-coney-island-1.10182810">For more infomation click here.</a>
